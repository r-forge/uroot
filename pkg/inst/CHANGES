## Version 1.0  November 26th, 2004 (Submitted to CRAN on January 12, 2005)

  - First version available from CRAN. It includes ADF, KPSS, HEGY, and CH tests, as well as some graphics.
    Several utilities, such as a graphical user interface, and tables in LaTeX format are also implemented.

## Version 1.1  February 3rd, 2005

  - DESCRIPTION file has been corrected. Current version of uroot does not include functions related to
    structural or periodic models.

  - A bug in seasonal box plot for quarterly series has been fixed. Parameter las=2 has been also changed to
    las=1.

  - A bug in HEGY and CH recursive testing has been fixed. The partition of the sample sometimes looked for
    periods out of the sample, becoming the funtion trapped in a loop with no end.

## Version 1.2 March 18th, 2005

  - Recursive testing had still problems when the first subsample has few observations with regard to the
    number of parameters. Criterium for selecting a top number of lags has changed to another one that tends
    to select a lower initial order. In particular, in functions AICBICaux, selecPv2, selecPv3, selecPv4, and
    TablaDet, the parameter "bp = round(10*log10(N))" has changed to "bp = round(12*(N/100)^0.5)". For next
    versions, it will be pondered on letting the user make this choice.

  - "round(4*(N/100)^0.25)" has been changed to "round(s*(N/100)^0.25)" in computation for the
     covariance matrix in CH test.

  - The function to extract the t-statistic from an lm object, called contts, has been changed. The
    function vcov is now used so that there is no need to invert a matrix.

  - Initial values for non-linear estimates in the function perdiff are set out as the coefficients entailed
    in the model when it is treated as if it were lineal. A summary of the nls estimation is also added.

  - The auxiliar function Tround has been modified. It rounds numbers in such a way that if the last decimal
    equals to zero, that zero is printed, hence, all the numbers in tables that are exported to a LaTeX format
    will display the same number of decimals.

  - Labels for significance in the HEGY recursive F-test when compdet=c(1,0,1) has been defined properly.

  - Argument "s" has been removed from "quarterg" and "bbmp".

  - "Makefiltra" has been added. It allows to transform the series removing the selected cycles. It creates a
    list object with the filtered time series and adds an item in the tree widget.

## Version 1.3 May 17th, 2005

  - system.file() is used so that the file names of files in package uroot are searched in a location
    independent way. There is no reason why the package should be installed in R_HOME/library/uroot. There is
    no guarantee that the path separator is "/", although that works on all current platforms. Example:
    "mytkpager(file.path(R.home(), "library/uroot/data/source_capv"),...)" is replaced by
    "mytkpager(system.file("data", "source_capv", package="uroot"),...)".

  - Added monthlypath() from the package stats to the GUI (Graphics - Seasonal series).

  - Rebuilt read data from .txt dialog box and the CH test about the frequencies dialog box.

  - The import data menu has been rebuilt.

  - Scrollbars in the main window are now scrollable.

## Version 1.4 October 10th, 2005

  - csv extension has been added to tkgetOpenFile in ReadDataCSV.

  - The function "Omegaf" used in "CHtest" for building and heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation consistent
    covariance matrix has changed. The lag truncation parameter is chosen by the user and the covariance
    matrix is directly symmetrical.

  - It is no longer required to set BWidget's path before installing "uroot". "BWidget" is available from
    the "uroot" directory and the corresponding tcl path is automatically added by "urootgui()". This was
    suggested by Uwe Ligges.

  - The data set has been exported to an .rda file and can be loaded from the R-console (not only from the
    GUI).

  - HEGY regressors are built in a shorter, and possibly quicklier, amount of code.

  - Lag selection methods has been reviewed and reduced to top-down AIC, BIC, and significant lags. When lag
    order in ADF.test and HEGY.test is selected by the user, it is possible to consider a single lag greater
    than first order.

  - The working series is no longer a list object, attributes of "ts" classes are used instead.

  - Classes and methods are defined to store and display the main information from the relevant functions. The
    main functions in the package creates an object of different classes so that methods to show ans
    summarize the output can be defined. The argument "showcat" is no longer needed.

  - "vdate" class has been added. Some methods for that class (based on other methods already defined for
    "ts" objects) allow to look up the date related to an observation in a "ts" object and vice versa.
    (File uroot/R/stepdate.R in the source code).

  - Buys-Ballot plot has been rebuilt takinf advantage of the "vdate" class and its related methods.

  - p-values for the unit roots statistics are displayed. For it, tables with critical values has been
    trasncribed to a file and depending on the sample size, the corresponding p-value is interpolated by
    means of "approx" from the package "stats". (File uroot/R/urt-cvtables.R in the source code).

  - The code for the recursive testing has been simplified and one more type of subsamples can be considered,
    moving subsamples. (file uroot/R/rec-test.R in the source code).

  - Changes above have entailed some changes in the GUI, some items have been dropped and other facilities
    have been added. The rationale of the tree is keeped.

  - Default values have been added to some arguments in some functions.
