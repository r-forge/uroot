  \title{Factor Seasonal Differencing Filter}

  \description{
    Factor seasonal differencing filter in quarterly and monthly time series.
  }

  \usage{
    factorsdiff (wts, factors)
  }

  \arguments{
    \item{wts}{a univariate time series object.}
    \item{factors}{the factors of the seasonal differencing filter to apply to the data.}
  }

  \details{
    \code{fators} is a 0-1 vector of length \eqn{S/2+1}, where \eqn{S} is the periodicity of the time series.
    The frequencies are ordered in the vector as follows: c(zero, pi, pi/2) for quarterly series and c(zero,
    pi, pi/2, 2pi/3, pi/3, 5pi/6, pi/6) for monthly series.

    A zero in the element \code{i} of the vector indicates that the cycle associated to the corresponding
    frequency will not be filtered. The cycles related to frequencies that are set equal to 1 are filtered.
  }

  \value{A list containing: Data of the filtered series, coefficients and lags of the polynomial that
    configure the filter.}
