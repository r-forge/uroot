  \title{Canova-Hansen Test}

  \description{
    This function computes the Canova-Hansen statistic for testing the null hypothesis of stationary seasonal
    cycles against the alternative of seasonal unit roots.}

  \usage{
    CH.test (wts, frec=NULL, f0=1, DetTr=FALSE, ltrunc=NULL)
  }

  \arguments{
    \item{wts}{a univariate time series object.}
    \item{frec}{a vector indicating the cycles to analyse. By default, all seasonal cycles are tested.}
    \item{f0}{a 0-1 (No-Yes) vector of length one indicating wether a first lag of the dependent variable is
      included or not in the auxiliar regression. See details.}
    \item{DetTr}{a logical argument. If TRUE a linear trend is included in the auxiliar regression.}
    \item{ltrunc}{lag truncation parameter for computing the residuals covariance matrix. By default,
      \eqn{round(s*(N/100)^0.25)}, where \eqn{s} is the periodicity of the data and \eqn{N} the number of
      observations.}
  }

  \details{
    Elements of \code{frec} must be set equal to 0 if the season assigned to this element is not considered
    and equals to 1 for the frequencies to analyse. The position of each frequency in the vector is as
    follows: c(pi/2, pi) for quarterly series and c(pi/6, pi/3, pi/2, 2pi/3, 5pi/6, pi) for monthly series.
