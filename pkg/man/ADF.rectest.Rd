  \title{Augmented Dickey-Fuller Recursive Test}

  \description{
    This function computes the augmented Dickey-Fuller statistic recursively along subsamples of the original
    data.
  }

  \usage{
    ADF.rectest (wts, type="moving", nsub=48, itsd, selectlags=list(mode="signf", Pmax=NULL),
                 trace=list(remain=1, plot=0, elaps=1))
  }

  \arguments{
    \item{wts}{a univariate time series object.}
    \item{type}{a character string indicating how subsamples are selected. See details.}
    \item{nsub}{the number of observations in each subsample.}
    \item{itsd}{deterministic components to include in the model. Three types of regressors can be
      included: regular deterministic components, seasonal deterministic components, and any regressor
      variable previously defined by the user.

      This argument must be a vector object with the following elements: \code{c(0,0,c(0))},
      if the first and/or second elements are set equal to 1, it indicates that an intercept, and/or linear
      trend, respectively, are included. The third element is a vector indicating which seasonal
      dummies should be included. If no seasonal dummies are desired it must be set equal to zero. For
      example, \code{regular=c(1,0,c(1,2,3))} would include an intercept, no trend, and the first three
      seasonal dummies.}
    \item{selectlags}{lag selection method. A list object indicating the method to select lags, \code{mode},
      and the maximum lag considered. Available methods are \code{"aic"}, \code{"bic"}, and \code{"signf"}.
      See details. \code{Pmax} is a numeric object indicating the maximum lag order. By default, the maximum
      number of lags considered is \eqn{round(10*log10(n))}, where \eqn{n} is the number of observations.}

    \item{trace}{a list object indicating if a trace of the iteration progress should be printed. Three
      levels of information can be printed: \code{remain}, the percentage of the whole procedure that has
      been completed; \code{plot}, a plot of the computed statistics; and \code{elaps}, how much time the
      whole procedure has consumed.}
  }

  \details{
    The auxiliar regression is defined as,

    \eqn{\delta y_t = \rho y_{t-1} + \epsilon_t,}

    where \eqn{\delta} is the first order operator. Hence, under the null hypothesis \eqn{\rho=0} and the
    long run unit root 1 exists.

    Three types of subsamples are considered: "backw", the statistic is computed for the last \code{nsub}
    observations and then one year backwards is added until the beginning of the sample; "forw", the
    statistic is computed for the first \code{nsub} observations and then one year forwards is added until
    the end of the sample; "moving", the statistic is computed over moving subsamples of length \code{nsub}.

    Available methods are the following. \code{"aic"} and \code{"bic"} follows a top-down strategy based on
    the Akaike's and Schwarz's information criteria, and \code{"signf"} removes the non-significant lags at
    the 10\% level of significance until all the selected lags are significant. By default, the maximum
    number of lags considered is \eqn{round(10*log10(n))}, where \eqn{n} is the number of observations.

    It is also possible to set the argument \code{selectlags} equals to a vector, \code{mode=c(1,3,4)}, then
    those lags are directly included in the auxiliar regression and \code{Pmax} is ignored.

    Regressor variables are not considered in this procedure.
