<h2>uroot R package</h2>

<p>This package contains several functions for analysing quarterly and monthly time series such as unit root tests (ADF, KPSS, HEGY, and CH) and a graphical tools for Buys-Ballot and seasonal cycles, among others. It allows the user to perform either an analytical or a graphical analysis.</p>

<p>Combined use of both enables the user to characterize the seasonality as deterministic, stochastic or a mixture of them. An easy to use graphical user interface is also provided to run some of the implemented functions.</p>

<p>You can find it in <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/uroot/index.html">CRAN</a> and can be installed using R's install.package function.</p>
